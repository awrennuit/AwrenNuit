## Why hello there üëã

I'm awren nuit (AHren nwee) and I absolutely love learning, solving problems, and bringing ideas to life.  My core philosophy is that everybody should try something outside of their comfort zone every day, and that everybody has something to teach.  Being a software engineer is eternally frustrating, and I mean that in a positive way.  It's that rare kind of frustration that brings joy as each bit of the problem is unraveled.  I mostly work with JavaScript and tend to gravitate towards frontend work (it's the artist in me). However, I'm more than comfortable setting up servers or REST APIs and structuring databases.

Aside from software development I am a plant enthusiast, [musician](https://cavebirdrecords.bandcamp.com/), and have a deep passion for DEIB (diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging).  Ask me about my special cough syrup or my latest music project!

I'm always open to have a conversation about being a developer, landing that first role, or anything JavaScript. Feel free to email me at awren.nuit@gmail.com.
