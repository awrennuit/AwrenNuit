## Why hello there üëã

I'm awren nuit (AHren nwee) and I absolutely love learning, solving problems, and bringing ideas to life.  My philosophy is that everybody should try something outside of their comfort zone every day - that's where growth takes place.  Being a software engineer is eternally frustrating, and I mean that in a positive way.  It's that rare kind of frustration that hones skills and brings joy.  I mostly work with JavaScript and tend to gravitate towards frontend work (it's the artist in me). However, I'm more than comfortable setting up servers or REST APIs and structuring databases.

Aside from software development I am an herbalist, [musician](https://cavebirdrecords.bandcamp.com/), and have a deep passion for DEIB (diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging).  Ask me about my favorite herbs or my special cough syrup!

I'm always open to have a conversation about being a developer, landing that first role, or anything JavaScript. Feel free to email me at awren.nuit@gmail.com.
